This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project
Introduction
This is a small project made from my experience on much bigger project that required me to edit and upload pdfs 
so i wanted to share this little tool that i made as an open source hoping it would help someone else on his journey or help people who want an easy way to extract pages from a pdf file and create new one 
functionality 
- upload multi pdf and extract pages from them 
- rearrange pages with a simple drag and drop 
-add picture as an extra pdf page 
- edit on a pdf page by drawing adding text 
- plan tool for architects alows u to easly select progress on an architecture plan 
- and finaly extract a modified pdf
sorry for the simple ui and lack of responsivness after all this is a side project
